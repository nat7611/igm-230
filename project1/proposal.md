### High Concept

A tank shooter game where the player must find the correct upgrades hidden around the map to beat the enemies.

### Genre

Top-down 2D shooter, with a hint of exploration, stealth, and puzzle solving. It is Player vs. Enemies, though PvP is theoretically possible.

### Gameplay

The player is put into a playing field with one or more enemies and hazards, and the goal is to defeat all of the enemies. The player robot is destroyed in a single hit, and all progress in a level is undone upon dying, but there is no life count. Because of the player's frailty, cover is very important, as it is in many shooters. Until the player gets the upgrades necessary to defeat the enemies, he or she will often have to rely on stealth to avoid losing to them. Upgrades are located around the level, sometimes in the open but often hidden in crevices, blocked by obstacles, or guarded by enemies. Some upgrades may be required to get other upgrades, but not all upgrades in a given level are guaranteed to be necessary to winning.

### Controls

Like many top-down shooters, movement is controlled independently from aiming. WASD and the arrow keys are both acceptable options for movement, and aiming is controlled by the mouse. Left-click fires the standard weapon, and right-click fires whatever alternate weapon has been found and is equipped. Q uses whatever utility has been found and is currently equipped. Any upgrade that must be triggered gets assigned to numbers 1-9 as they are collected, and only one upgrade each of the weapon and utility varieties can be equipped at a time for control simplification. This will be indicatd by the UI.

### Story

There is little story to this game. Someone wanted to build scenarios for little robots to overcome, so they made them.

### Aesthetics

The game will have a toy theme to it. The environment will be made out of wood blocks and other materials like foam that are clearly set up for the designated purpose of being an arena for this game. The player and enemy robots will look like something made by high schoolers for a robotics competition.

### Other information

This game was inspired by the Tank mini-game in _Wii Play_, which is surprisingly long and tactical for a mini-game and would probably pass as a full, if low-budget, game if it was released solo. I want to capitalize on that.
